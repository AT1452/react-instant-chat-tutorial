#Building an instant chat app using ReactJs and Socket.io
#Introduction
ReactJs is one of the most popular technologies on the web today due to it's simplicity and speed. It is important to note that ReactJS is not a framework, it is a library, thus it is unfair to compare it to other technologies such as AngularJs or Ember. Web frameworks, such as AngularJs, provide the developer with most tools they need to develop a comprehensive front-end app such as pre-built functions for routing, form validation, http service requests and many more. However, the ReactJs library purely focuses on the view layer and leaves the other complexities for developer to manage. This gives the developer much more control over how the various features are implemented.

This tutorial will guide the reader through the development of a simple instant chat application, similar to Facebook Messenger, built using ReactJs and Socket.io. This tutorial assumes that you already have a basic understanding of the ReactJs framework and ES6 syntax. If you know nothing about these two, I suggest you stop reading here and check out the following articles:
